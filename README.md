# Average Rolls
A module for Foundry VTT.

This is a simple module to get average rolls per user per session. 

## How to:
 - Install and enable it, you can use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeardedJotunn/FoundryVTT-AverageRolls/master/module.json for manual install.
 - Make a macro with the following script to send a message to chat with everybody's average:
 - outputAverages();

## Future Plans:
 - Add lifetime averages.
 - Better way to display averages.
 - Perhaps some Discord connection. 

Was originally going to be a Discord Bot module which is why I forked DiscordBridge by nearlyNonexistent. However I ended up quickly diverging from that but maybe it will return one day.
